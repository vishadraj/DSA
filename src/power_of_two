# 231 Power of Two
Question :- Given an integer , write a function



Methodology to solve this problem
1. Brute force
2. Bitwise operations (  jab bhi koi no 2 ka power hota hai then pure no me sirf ek bit hii 1 hoga   )

Intuition : Brute Force method

If a number is a power of 2, it reduces to 1, if we recursively divide it by 2 while the Remainder is 0

Algo :- Divide the input by 2, till the remainder is =0;
Check if the number is reduced to 1
 if yes return True
 else return false


 LeetCode problem number 231
:- Brute force
 class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n){
        if(n==0) return false;
        while(n%2==0) n/=2;
        return n ==1;
    }
 }

Bitwise operations :-
if a number is a power of 2, its binary form will contain a 1 followed by zeros.
It will contain only only 1 bit and rest would be zeros.

Binary form for 2 : 10                                     Contains exactly one 1 bit
Binary form for 4 : 100
Binary form for 8 : 1000

Binary form for 3 : 11
Binary form for 5 : 101                                    contains more than One 1-bit
Binary form for 10 : 1010



1 . form number starting with rightmost 1 for 8
 x&(-x) : logic for right most bit and add

                | Right most 1 bit
                1000 -> 1000
                1000 = 1000

                | rightmost 1 bit
                110 -> 10
                110 != 10

   jo number hai uska 1's complement then 2's complement than check the given no is equal to original no or not;

   class Solution {
         public boolean isPowerOfTwo (int n){
            if (n==0) return false;
            long x = (long) n;
            return (x & (-x)) == x;
         }
   }


               OR

    class Solution {
            public boolean isPowerOfTwo (int n){
               if (n==0) return false;
               long x = (long) n;
               return (x & (x-1)) == 0;
            }
      }

   Intuition :

   If a number is a power of 2, the number formed by , setting the rightmost 1 bit will be equal to zero
   While if the number contains more one's the Number formed starting whit the rightmost 1 to 0. will not be equal to 0.
