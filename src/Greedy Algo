Greedy Technique (Algorithm)
   -> Follow local optimal choice at each stage with intend of finding global optimum.
      Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.
      So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for Greedy.
   -> Feasible Solution
   -> Optimal Solution ==> minimum cost, Max Profit, Min Risk,
 Application :-
    -> Knapsack Problem
    -> Job Sequencing
    -> Minimum Spanning Tree
    -> Optimal Merge Pattern
    -> Huffman Codding
    -> Dijkstra's Algorithm
